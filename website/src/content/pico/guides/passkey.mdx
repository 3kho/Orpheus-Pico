This guide will teach you how to use your Orpheus Pico as a 2-factor
authentication passkey like a Yubikey. This is a great first project as it
doesn't require anything other than the Orpheus Pico itself!

## Introduction

Ever seen one of those fancy-shmancy Yubikeys and wanted one? Well, in this
guide, I'll explain how you can make your very own device for 2-factor
authentications and passkeys using nothing but your Orpheus Pico and some
open-source code :D

## Required materials

-   Orpheus Pico
-   USB-C cable
-   A chrome-based web browser (or any browser supporting WebSerial)

## Instructions

### Download the firmware

Download the latest version of the Pico Fido software from the GitHub Releases
page [here](https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido/releases/latest).  
Unzip it, find `pico_fido_pico-<VERSION>.uf2`, and rename it to `firmware.uf2`.
Save it somewhere you'll remember!

### Install to your Orpheus Pico

Plug your Orpheus Pico into your Type-C cable, and plug the other end into your
computer. While holding down the "BOOT" button, quickly press the "RESET"
button. If you've done this correctly, a new USB drive should appear on your
computer called `RPI-RP2`. Now, simply drag-and-drop (or copy) the
`firmware.uf2` file from before to the newly-created drive. It may take a second
but once it's done transferring the disk drive should disappear.

### Prep your Pico Key

In order to use your newly-flashed authentication key, you'll need to
"commission" it first. This sets all of the customizable features that we'll
need to change.  
Visit the [Pico Commissioner tool](https://www.picokeys.com/pico-commissioner/)
and scroll down to the configuration section. The vendor and product IDs
("VID"/"PID") are a part of the USB specification and allow the computer to
determine who the manufacturer of a USB device is, and which product it is. This
can matter if you want to use a software designed for a specific key. If you're
not sure, a safe bet is "YubiKey 4/5".  
The presence button timeout and LED brightness are up to you, but it's safe to
keep them at the default if you want to.  
For the options on the side, go with "LED dimmable" and "Power Cycle on Reset".
You can learn more about the other values on the Pico Fido GitHub, but they're
out of the scope of this tutorial. The product name's up to you, you can leave
this as "Pico Key" or set it as you want. This is what will show up in your
operating system. I went with "Orphenticator" :)

Lastly and most importantly is the LED GPIO pin field. This matters to us
because while the Raspberry Pi Pico (what the firmware is built for) has its
built-in LED on GPIO25, the Orph Pico's is on GPIO23.

### Last steps

Now that all of the settings are configured, go ahead and press "Commission via
WebAuthn". If all goes well, you should see a popup from your operating system
asking you to set up your key.  
You'll be asked to set a PIN - **make sure you don't forget it!**  
Lastly, it'll prompt you to "touch your key". As we've set it up, this means
press the BOOT button on your Orpheus Pico.

## Usage

That's it! Your Orpheus Pico-based authenticator device is now ready to use just
the same as you would a Yubikey.
